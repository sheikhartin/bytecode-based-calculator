This project aims to calculate mathematical expressions after converting them to bytecode!

### Using the REPL

The REPL supports several flags that modify its behavior:

- `-l`: Display the output of the lexer, which shows the tokenized version of the input.
- `-p`: Display the output of the parser, which shows the parsed structure of the input.
- `-g`: Display the generated bytecode for the input expression.

You can use these flags individually or in combination to see the different stages of interpretation. For example:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go -l -p -g
```

This command will display the lexer output, parser output, and generated bytecode before executing the expression.
